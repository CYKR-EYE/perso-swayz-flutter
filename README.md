## 🤔 What is Swayz?

Swayz is a modern social sharing application designed to be a beautiful and privacy-respecting alternative to existing platforms. Inspired by the ephemeral nature of Snapchat, ease of use and features, Swayz aims to provide a richer, more ethical, and a volontary donation based experience.

We believe social media should connect people without compromising their privacy or forcing them into freemium models. Swayz is built on this principle.

## 🚀 Core Features

- 💸 **Truly Free:** No hidden costs, no premium features behind paywalls. Ever.
- 🎉 **Rich Functionality:** Explore a wide range of creative tools, filters, and interaction options (More details coming soon!).
- ⚡ **Powered by Supabase:** Leveraging the power of Supabase for a scalable and robust backend (Authentication, Database, Storage).
- 📱 **Cross-Platform:** Built with Flutter for a seamless experience on both iOS and Android and Desktop in the future.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Flutter
- **Backend:** Supabase (Auth, Realtime Database, Storage)
